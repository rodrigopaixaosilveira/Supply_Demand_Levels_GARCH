# ðŸ“Š Volatility-Adapted Supply & Demand Bands

This Streamlit app visualizes **Supply & Demand bands adjusted by volatility using the GARCH model**.

The methodology was originally developed by **Leandro Guerra (Outspoken Market, OM QuantLab)**, and this implementation by **Rodrigo PaixÃ£o Silveira** adapts it by applying the **GARCH model** to project **weekly and monthly bands**.
